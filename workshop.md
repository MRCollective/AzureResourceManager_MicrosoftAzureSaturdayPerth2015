# Azure Resource Manager Workshop

## Exercise 1 - deploy a Web App using Azure Resource Manager 

1. Use the Deploy To Azure button on the [Demo site we've created](workshop/DemoSiteToDeploy) to deploy an Azure Web App including the deployment of [our HTML](workshop/DemoSiteToDeploy/DemoSiteToDeploy/index.html)
2. Once it succeeds, find your Web App in the Portal and open it
3. Click on the Register button and look at the presentation screen to see your site pop up!
4. If you click on the Register button subsequent times then it will tell you that you have already registered

Congratulations! You've now used Azure Resource Manager.

The JSON definition for the site you just created can be [found on GitHub](workshop/DemoSiteToDeploy/azuredeploy.json), as can the [JSON definition](workshop/AzureSaturdayPerth2015Api/azuredeploy.json) and [code](workshop/AzureSaturdayPerth2015Api) of the site that hosted the API (that one includes a SQL database and auto-deploy from GitHub!).
