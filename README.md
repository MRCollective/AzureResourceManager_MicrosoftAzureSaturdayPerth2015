## Azure Resource Manager

Azure Resource Manager is the recent addition to Azure that underpins the way Azure manages and provisions “resources” – things like your websites, sql databases, virtual machines, etc. The new Azure portal uses the new resource manager. It significantly simplifies how resources are created and specified and adds a lot of consistency to the Azure ecosystem – for instance there are 33 Azure Resource Manager PowerShell commandlets versus 108 commandlets for the previous incarnation. This session will explore what Azure Resource Manager is, why it’s important, how to learn about it and use it and take participants through some exercises to allow them to experiment with the Azure Resource Manager and provision resources using it.
